                <h2>Box breathing</h2>
                <p><b>Box breathing</b> is a breathing technique that can be used to calm down during a stressful situation. By simply breathing in a rhythmic pattern, one's heartrate can decrease and return to normal.<br><br><b>Try using the animation below to practice box breathing!</b> Whenever the box gets bigger, take a deep breath in. Hold that breath until the box starts to get smaller, and slowly exhale.</p>

                <h2>50 Activities</h2>
                <p>Let's be honest, being bored is never fun. Occasional boredom is perfectly healthy, and <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/08/you-need-to-be-bored-heres-why" target="_blank">even should be embraced sometimes</a>! However, if boredom gets difficult to tolerate and start to impact your mood, <b>here's a list of fifty activities</b> to do to occupy yourself!</p>
                <p><small>(List was taken from <a href="https://parade.com/1219503/marynliles/things-to-do-by-yourself#best-things-to-do-by-yourself" target="_blank"><i>Parade's</i> article of a similar name</a>)</small></p>
                <ol id="fiftyActivitiesList">
                    <li>Learn a new skill. From card tricks to baking, the world is your oyster!</li>
                    <li>Clean an area in your home. Start small, or take on a more daring room!</li>
                    <li>Head out for a long walk. Find a nearby nature trail and take in the scenery!</li>
                    <li>Learn a new language. Find out different ways to say the same greeting in different languages.</li>
                    <li>Take some time to meditate. Or if you can't clear your thoughts, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356" target="_blank">practice mindfulness</a>.</li>
                    <li>Write a song. Make it about someone important in your life as a way to say thank-you!</li>
                    <li>Take a virtual (or physical!) trip to a museum. See the exhibits they have to offer.</li>
                    <li>Try a new recipe or restaurant. Recipes are easily accessible online, and you might just find your new favorite lunch!</li>
                    <li>Create a bucket list. You don't have to think way ahead, make a bucket list that you'd like to complete before summer starts!</li>
                    <li>Enforce a new healthy habit. Plan to go to sleep earlier, or make your bed after getting up.</li>
                    <li>Watch a fast-paced movie. Action movies keep you in the moment and engaged in the plot.</li>

                    <li>Listen to music. Revisit an album you've been wanting to binge-listen to, or explore your favorite band's discography.</li>
                    <li>Sky gaze. Lay a blanket outside and watch the clouds float by. What shapes or objects do you see?</li>
                    <li>Buy an item you've been eyeing. If that phone charm is cute and your budget allows it, go right ahead and treat yourself! (Just don't overspend!)</li>
                    <li>Text a friend. Catch up on the latest news, or plan a time to hang out.</li>

                    <li>Learn a new dance. Dances are prevalent in social media, why not learn a couple of them?</li>

                    <li>Make DIY posters. Or really just stick anything to your wall: printed photos, coloring book pages, collages, or assorted knick-knacks with a story behind them!</li>
                    <li>Go for a drive around town. See if you can find any places you don't recognize, or any oddities while on the road.</li>
                    <li>Plan your dream vacation. Why stop at one destination when the whole world awaits your imagination!</li>
                    <li>Learn to play an instrument. Or try to learn a song on <a href="https://virtualpiano.net/" target="_blank">this virtual piano</a>!</li>
                    <li>Watch the sunset. Take the time to observe the sky changing colors, or the road lights turning on.</li>
                    <li>Go for a hike. Many towns have nature hiking events that anyone can participate in. Just be sure to bring the right shoes and some water!</li>

                    <li>Learn the benefits of meal-prepping. It can take a lot of time and thinking off your hands.</li>
                    <li>Learn calligraphy, or improve your handwriting. Calligraphy is an important skill, and can be used to make a fancy signature!</li>
                    <li>Give yourself a makeover. And not just the makeup kind; try out some different clothes, or an accessory you never got to style.</li>
                    <li>Start a blog. Starting a blog on a dedicated website is not as hard as it seems, and can leave you a little more tech savvy!</li>
                    <li>Watch your favorite TV show. See how many episodes you can get in!</li>
                    <li>Visit your local library. Many libraries have toys and DVDs you can borrow, not just books.</li>
                    <li>Visit a stand-up comedy or karaoke event. Local bars and restaurants can host open-mic nights, so try singing your favorite song and building your confidence.</li>
                    <li>Go thrift shopping, or shop small-business. Shopping secondhand can lessen your carbon footprint, while shopping from small businesses supports passionate people at work!</li>

                    <li>Go for a bike ride around your neighborhood, and feel the breeze on your face.</li>

                    <li>Take a bubble bath. Pick your favorite bath bomb, and soak in the suds!</li>
                    <li>Make a gratitude list. Write down what you're grateful for, even if it's something small!</li>

                    <li>Take an online class in a topic you're interested in. It doesn't have to be a formal traditional class, an online YouTube series will do.</li>
                    <li>Go to your local park, and take in your surroundings.</li>
                    <li>Visit a farmer's market, and pick out some healthy, in-season produce.</li>

                <h2>About This Website</h2>
                <p>While this site was coded by <a href="https://rotten-egghead.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Izzy</a>, this site is heavily dedicated to someone who's been nothing but helpful to me and my family, and I am forever grateful for her kindness. She works with people similar to me who need a little extra help getting by, so I thought that gifting her a site to share to people who may need a destresser would be the perfect way to send her thanks.<br><br>Hence, Mezie's Corner was born! :-)</p>
